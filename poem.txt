In the woods, where whispers dwell,
Amidst the trees, a secret spell.
The moonlight weaves through branches high,
A lullaby beneath the sky.

In shadows deep, the nightbirds sing,
Their melodies on silent wing.
Stars above like diamonds bright,
Illuminate the velvet night.

A river weeps, its mournful cry,
Echoes of ages passing by.
Yet in its flow, a silent grace,
A journey carved in time and space.

Through dark and light, the forest roams,
A tapestry of ancient poems.
In every leaf, a story told,
Of love and loss, of days of old.

So let us wander, hand in hand,
Through mystic realms of untamed land.
For in this dance of life, we find,
A universe within the mind.
